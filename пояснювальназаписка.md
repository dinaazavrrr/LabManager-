# Course Project Explanation

## Project Title
**LabManager** â€” Console Application for Managing Lab Work Records

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a small but functional application for managing laboratory assignments. Users can add information about their labs, such as title, number, grade, and submission status, and review all added records via a simple command-line interface.

## Functional Overview
The application supports:
- Adding new lab entries
- Listing all saved labs
- Filtering labs by submission status
- Saving data persistently using a `.json` file

## Development Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Data storage**: JSON
- **Testing**: unittest module
- **Version control**: Git & GitHub
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration

## Development Methodologies
- Modular code structure (separating logic from UI)
- Test-driven development for core logic
- Use of version control for tracking changes
- Continuous Integration for automated testing

## Example Use Case
A student uses the application to log all lab assignments, mark which ones are completed, and check what is still pending.

## Outcome
This project helped me improve my practical skills in:
- File handling in Python
- Writing testable code and working with `unittest`
- Working with simple data persistence (JSON)
- Implementing CI/CD using GitHub Actions

The application was implemented successfully and meets all outlined requirements.
